# Creating a Sync App

The tools for uploading and syncing Mozu Applications require a separate Mozu Application to "run under". While you are working on your Mozu Application, your tools will sync it under the credentials of a different one, which you can call your *sync app*. Your sync app belongs to you as a developer; you can have one sync app per environment, and configure it permanently for all local apps you work on.

## Steps

###Create your Sync App as you would any application, by navigating to Applications in Developer Center and creating a new one.

###Give your application a short, memorable name and ID that have something to do with "sync" and your identity.
